From late 2011 to 2016, I worked as a senior consultant at
[Emaze](http://blog.emaze.net/), a security company based in Milan, Italy. Here
my activities included reverse engineering (mainly on embedded devices),
penetration testings, and training courses.

I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science on June 15, 2011 from
[Università degli Studi di Milano](http://www.unimi.it/) (University of Milan,
Italy), in the
[Computer and Network Security Lab](http://security.di.unimi.it/). My
Ph.D. thesis is titled "Dealing with next-generation malware"
([PDF](/pubs/thesis-phd.pdf), [slides](/pubs/thesis-phd-lecture.pdf)).

On April 16, 2007, I got my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from
[Università degli Studi di Milano](http://www.unimi.it/) with a final grade of
110/110 _cum laude_. The work I did for my M.Sc. thesis is titled "Dynamic
analysis of executable code" ([PDF](/pubs/thesis-ms.pdf), in Italian).
